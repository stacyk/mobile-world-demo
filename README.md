# Pre-Installation

Basic knowledge of the command line and the following dependencies are required to use wd_s:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Grunt CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-cli) - `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - `npm install -g bower`
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) - `gem install sass`

# Theme Setup

To get started, we'll download the files and then to do some finding and replacing:

1) [Download](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s/archive/master.zip) and extract the zip into your project's `wp-content/themes` directory and rename `wd_s` to fit your needs

2) Find & Replace

You'll need to change all instances of the names: `_s` to your project name. While this can be a tedious chore, SublimeText 3 can do a global "find & replace" allowing you to do this in under 60 seconds.

* Search for: `'wpdemo'` and replace with: `'project-name'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain
* Search for: `wpdemo_` and replace with: `project-name_` to capture all the function names
* Search for: `Text Domain: wpdemo` and replace with: `Text Domain: project-name` in style.css
* Search for (and include the leading space): <code>&nbsp;_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Project Name</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks
* Search for: `wpdemo-` and replace with: `project-name-` to capture prefixed handles
* Search for `wpdemo.pot` and replace with: `project-name.pot` to capture translation files

Once you've setup the theme, you can start the [install](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s#installation).

# Installation

1) From the command line, change directories to your new theme directory

```bash
cd /your-project/wordpress/wp-content/themes/your-theme
```

2) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install && bower install
```

You are now ready to use wd_s!

# How to use Grunt

1) From the command line, navigate to your theme

```bash
cd /your-project/wordpress/wp-content/themes/your-theme
```

2) Type any of the following Grunt tasks to perform an action:

`grunt watch` - Automatically handle changes to CSS, JS, SVGs, and image sprites. Plus live reload!

`grunt javascript` - Concatenate and minify javascript files

`grunt styles` - Comb, compile, prefix, combine media queries, and minify CSS files

`grunt imageminnewer` - Minify images

`grunt sprites` - Generate an image sprite and the associated Sass (sprite.png)

`grunt icons` - Generate the SVG sprite (svg-defs.svg)

`grunt i18n` - Generate a translation file

`grunt sassdoc` - Re-generate the SassDocs

`grunt` - Do all the above tasks at the same time
